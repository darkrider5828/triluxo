Flask Course Scraper
This Flask application is designed to scrape course data from the Brainlox website, extracting information about various technical courses, including titles, overviews, prices, and images. The extracted data can be stored, displayed, or further processed as needed.

The application features the ability to scrape course information from a specified URL, handle asynchronous requests for better performance, and display course data on a simple web interface. It is also easily extensible for additional features or data sources.

To get started, youâ€™ll need Python 3.7 or higher, along with Flask, BeautifulSoup4, Requests, and Selenium for dynamic content scraping. First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory. Then, create a virtual environment and activate it. Finally, install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

To run the application, execute the assignment.py script and open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the application interface. The application will automatically scrape course data when accessed.
